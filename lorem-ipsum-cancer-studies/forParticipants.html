        <h2>Information for Participants</h2><hr>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in our study!  We are grateful for everyone 
          who would like to help us.  
        <br><br>
        First: <span class="bold">If we invited you to our study, we are NOT saying you have
          cancer.</span>        
        <br><br>
        Do you have questions?  Let us answer those for you:
        <br><br>
        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        We are scientists working at the University
          of Lorem Ipsum School of Medicine in New York City, NY.  We have been
          studying cancer for over 30 years and learned a lot.  We need help from people like you  
          to learn even more.
        <br><br>
        <h3>What is the study about?</h3>
        This study is to learn why some people get cancer and other people don't.  We are looking at causes from the environment and from our genes.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Why was I invited?</h3>
          We need people with cancer and people without cancer to compare their health. We choose people from all over the state by luck and we don't know about their health at all.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Why would I do this?</h3>
        For you, this is a chance to help medical scientists learn how to help people heal faster and get less 
          sick in the future.  Also, we will pay you $50 for your time.
          <br><br>
        <h3>What would I be asked to do?</h3>
        We ask you to meet us for only one visit which lasts about one hour.  This visit involves:
          <ol>
            <li>Taking a short survey about your medical history;</li>
            <li>Drawing a small amount of blood;</li>
            <li>Collecting a urine sample.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3>Is this safe?</h3>
        We take our responsiblity to keep you safe very seriously.
        <br><br>
        A group of local leaders in our ethics group (the Human Research Protections Office, or HRPO) read our study plan and
        agreed the risk to subjects is minimal, and that there are only three risks to be aware of:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><i>Risk of getting a bruise.</i>  Like any blood draw, there is risk of a bruise with any blood draw, and   
            we use a butterfly needle, which is very small.</li>
          <li><i>Risk of feeling uncomfortable with personal questions.</i> We let you skip any 
            questions in the questionnaire that make you feel uncomfortable.  </li>
          <li><i>Risk of breach of privacy.</i>  Unfortunately there are hackers out in the world.  However,  
            the university takes many safeguards to keep your information safe.  Also, your 
          information is seen only by scientists who need to see it, and would only be used for 
        this one research project.</li>
        </ol>
        You will have time to read the consent form before agreeing to it.  It has
        all these details and more about being a subject in our study, so you can decide if 
        it is right for you.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Still have questions?</h3>
        If have any questions or concerns about the study, you should first reach out to 
        our study lead, <a href="contactUs.html" target="_blank">Dr. Ipsum</a>.  If 
        you have further concerns, you may reach out to 
        <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html" style="display:inline" target="_blank">the HRPO.</a></p>
